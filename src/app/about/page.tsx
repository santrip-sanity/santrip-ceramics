                Our approach combines time-honored techniques with contemporary innovation. 
                We work primarily with stoneware and porcelain, using both wheel-throwing and hand-building 
                methods to create our pieces.

              <p className="text-neutral-700 font-light leading-relaxed">
                From initial shaping to final glaze firing, each step is carefully considered. 
                We embrace the beauty of imperfection â€“ the variations that make each piece truly unique.

                We believe in the power of handmade objects to connect us to both 
                the natural world and to each other. In an increasingly digital age, we find meaning in 
                the physical act of creation.
